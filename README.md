Predicting Uber NYC Pickup Demands using different models and ANN Architectures
Submitted by : Shriya Garg | Bennett University
Objective:
In this project, I attempted to visualize, explore and experiment various different models and ANN techniques that would effectively as well as efficiently predict the Uber NYC Pickups Demand. This is an extension of the other project that we did on Bike-sharing Demand.

This is a unique problem with huge amount of datasets but only 2 considerable classes.

Steps Involved :
* Data Preprocessing
* Visualizations
* Splitting of Dataset
* Training and Testing on various models
* Time Series Forecasting (Sarima, Arima, Holt Winter, Holt Linear)
* AR Model
* Exponential Smoothing
* ANN Model
* Results
